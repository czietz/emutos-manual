# EmuTOS Documentation #

This repository is for [EmuTOS](https://emutos.sourceforge.io/) documentation. That consists for now of a user manual.

Note to contributors: The HTML manual is served by GitHub Pages from the 'gh-pages' branch that is automatically updated. Please do not modify the 'gh-pages' branch manually, as your changes would be overwritten. Just push your mkdocs source code to the 'master' branch, as usual.

## User Manual ##

The EmuTOS User Manual. Start here if you know nothing about how to use EmuTOS. For more information, see the User Manual.

Tools required: git, mkdocs, the exclude extension to mkdocs.
