# EmuTOS Documentation #

This repository is for [EmuTOS](https://emutos.sourceforge.io/) documentation. That consists for now of a user manual.

## User Manual ##

The EmuTOS User Manual. Start here if you know nothing about how to use EmuTOS. For more information, see the User Manual.

Tools required: git, mkdoc. Really nice to have: make, rsync (for shipping to my web site), and some sort of table of contents generator. I use Emacs' markdown-toc mode, but I think any decent Markdown ToC generator should work.
